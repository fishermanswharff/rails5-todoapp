 tasklists:
  model:
    validations
    accepts_nested_attributes_for :todo
  controller methods:
    before_filter authenticate_user, permissions based on role
    edit ? do I need an edit action?, maybe only need an update action with inline forms, rather than unique views for the edit action
    create
      should accept nested attributes for todos so we can create a todo and a list at the same time
    update
    destroy
      should destroy all children associations as well
  views:
    form to create new list, with optional todo to immediately populate list
todos:
  model:
    validations
    logic
  controller:
    index
    show
    edit
    create
    update
    destroy
user:
  model:
    validations
    logic for polymorphic associations
  controller:
    login
    logout
    index
    show
    edit
    create
    update
    destroy
